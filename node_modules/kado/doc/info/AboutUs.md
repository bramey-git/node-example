# About Us

There is already a lot of information about Kado on this site, this page will
attempt to make Kado as short and concise as possible.

* Have you been building websites since the internet started? Or just recently?
* Do you find it difficult to get from an idea to a final product?
* Do you get tired of learning to new technology to produce the same product?

If so, we understand your pain and want to help. Kado is a curated friendly
development environment. Kado loves websites but will work anywhere for any
purpose.

[Kado](https://kado.org) is a collection of JavaScript libraries that utilizes
tried and true development tactics to provide a common environment, which vastly
reduces application development time.

If you are ready to give Kado a try [install the demo](../guide/QuickStart.md)!
